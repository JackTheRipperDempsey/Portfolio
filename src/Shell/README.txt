This is a shell written for my operating systems class.  It was designed as a more advanced project encompassing redirection, pipelining, and job control.  While my code isn’t perfect (the redirection and pipelining are both fairly, but job control is shaky, likely as a result of inadequate signal handling), I decided to include as it remains the biggest low-level effort I’ve undertaken so far.  All code written by me except for the tokenizer.c file.

Language: C
