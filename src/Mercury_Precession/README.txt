While not a .m file itself, this is the writeup for the simulation of the precession of Mercury I wrote in MATLAB for my computational mechanics course.  Because I ran my experiments measuring the time of the precession from MATLAB’s command window, I don’t have a singular file to submit for that.  However, the appendices for the report contain not only the definitions of my helper functions but also records of the exact commands entered.
